        Creates a filter object, based on filter options, to notify when the state changes (logs).
        - To check if the state has changed, call klay_getFilterChanges.
        - To obtain all logs matching the filter created by klay_newFilter, call klay_getFilterLogs.

        **A note on specifying topic filters:** Topics are order-dependent. A transaction with a log with topics [A, B] will be matched by the following topic filters:
        - [] "anything"
        - [A] "A in first position (and anything after)"
        - [null, B] "anything in first position AND B in second position (and anything after)"
        - [A, B] "A in first position AND B in second position (and anything after)"
        - [[A, B], [A, B]] "(A OR B) in first position AND (A OR B) in second position (and anything after)"

        NOTE: In versions earlier than Klaytn v1.7.0, only integer block number, the string "earliest" and "latest" are available.

        **JSONRPC:** `klay_newFilter`

        **NOTE:** In versions earlier than Klaytn v1.7.0, only integer block number, the string "earliest" and "latest" are available.
